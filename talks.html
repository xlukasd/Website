                <h2>GitHub Copilot: The smartest way to code?</h2>
                <h3>Target audience</h3>
                <p>SW Engineers, QA Engineers, SW Development Team Leaders</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>This workshop “GitHub Copilot: The Smartest Way to Code” is designed to help software developers learn how to use GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code suggestion tool that can help you write code faster and more efficiently. The workshop will cover topics such as setting up GitHub Copilot, configuring it, troubleshooting, and using it with Visual Studio (Code). The workshop will include a hands-on exercise where you will develop with AI-powered code suggestions using GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio (Code). By the end of the workshop, you will have a good understanding of how to use GitHub Copilot and how it can help you write better code leading to better software quality.</p>

                <h3>Target audience</h3>
                <p>SW Engineers, QA Engineers, Product Owners, Business Analysts</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>This talk explores the concept of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and its application in software development. The talk will delve into the differences between Anemic Domain Model (ADM) and Rich Domain Model (RDM) and how they shape system scalability, maintainability, and overall quality. The speaker will discuss the building blocks of a Rich Domain Model, such as Entity, Value Objects, and Aggregate Root, and how they help build a ubiquitous language between developers and stakeholders using a vocabulary that describes the business rules. The talk will also cover the importance of context boundaries in DDD and how they help define the entities, value objects, and aggregates that model the domain.</p>
